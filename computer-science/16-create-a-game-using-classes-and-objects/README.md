# Project: Create a Game Using Classes and Objects

## The Challenge

Welcome! You should now be equipped with everything you need to make a complicated program that uses multiple classes that interact with each other. This is where we turn the creativity over to you.

For this project, we want you to create a fully functional system that involves multiple classes. We‚Äôll give more details on the specific requirements below.

We know that it can sometimes be hard to come up with an idea on your own. Take some time to think of what you want to create ‚Äî it truly can be anything. This step is important! We want you to feel motivated to complete this project, so pick something you‚Äôre excited to make.

If you can‚Äôt think of any ideas, here are some examples of systems that you could create.

- Create a Pokemon-like game where your Classes could be different types of Creatures that can battle each other. You could create a system where you have a Trainer class that has multiple Creatures. You could create Items to use on those Creatures.
- Create a Casino with multiple types of Games. You could then create a Player that has an amount of money that they can wager on the different Games you created.
- Create a Store that has an inventory of food Items. You could then have a Shopper class that can purchase items from the Store.
- Create a high school simulator. You could create a School class that can interact with Students, Teachers, and Courses. You could create a whole little world of different students taking different classes, where you could track things like their grades, favorite subjects, and friendships.
One small note on running your code. We‚Äôve given you access to a real terminal in this project. This will let you use functions like input() to get input from the user. (If you‚Äôve never used input() before, you can read our article about it, or check out the documentation. Note that this is totally optional, but it can make your program more interactive.

Because we‚Äôve given you a real terminal, running your code might be slightly different than what you‚Äôve seen before. After writing your code in the script.py file, save your code using the Save button. Then, in the terminal, type:

``` shell
python3 script.py
```

and press Enter/Return on your keyboard to run your code.

If you want to test this out, try running our demo code. We‚Äôve given you the file pokemon.py, which contains our implementation of a game of Pokemon. You can take a look at this code, and when you are ready, try running it using

```shell
python3 pokemon.py
```

in the terminal. The program will then start and you will be prompted to enter some information into the terminal.

Below you will find the requirements for this project. Check off these requirements as you complete them!
