## The Challenge

Magic 8-Ball
The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.

Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù question with a different fortune each time it executes.

Magic 8-Ball, should I do this project?

We‚Äôll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:

- Yes - definitely
- It is decidedly so
- Without a doubt
- Reply hazy, try again
- Ask again later
- Better not tell you now
- My sources say no
- Outlook not so good
- Very doubtful

The output of the program will have the following format:

```terminal
[Name] asks: [Question]
Magic 8-Ball‚Äôs answer: [Answer]
```

For example:

```terminal
Joe asks: Is this real life?
Magic 8-Ball's answer: Better not tell you now
```
